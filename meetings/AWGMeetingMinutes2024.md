# AWG Meeting Notes 2024
Following are meeting notes for AWG meetings beginning on February 13, 2024 moving forward.  

Between November/2020 and February/2024 meeting minutes, discussions and decisions were recorded on
the AWG Groups.io email list and Groups.io AWG groups page.  Beginning February 13, 2024, minutes of meeting will be hosted in this file.   Proposed agenda topics, community discussions and recorded decisions will continue to be
distributed through the AWG Groups.io directly to email boxes of AWG members.   Each AWG email proposing agenda items for a meeting will have a link to this file so that minutes/notes are easily and quickly accessible to those receiving the email.     

The format of this file will be a series of sections with each section having agenda items and any recorded discussion on that topic.    The most recent meeting notes will be at the top of the file. Prior to the meeting, each meeting notes "section" will "pre populated" with the agenda items for that meeting.  Any member of the community can propose additional information for any meeting by issuing a Github Pull Request (PR).  PRs will be moderated (and committed) by the AWG Chair.

It is expected that AWG members will contribute to each of the sections.  Without AWG membership contribution, some sections may remain empty.

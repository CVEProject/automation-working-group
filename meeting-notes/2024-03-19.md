## Agenda

* CVE Services Testing Status

## Notes

* CVE Services Testing Status - Testing has begun on CVE Services rc 2.3.0.    There have been a number of issues that have been identified to include: [Issue #1216](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1216), [Issue #1210](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1210), [Issue #1209](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1209), [Issue #1207](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1207), [Issue #1206](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1206), [Issue #1205](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1205), and [Issue #1204](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1204).

 We will adjudicate each of these issues at a future meeting as we will be gathering more test resutls over the next couple of weeks.   
 
 For this meeting we focussed on Issue #1204 because this an issue that was deemed as a is a "blocker" to continued testing and most certainly was going to be fixed prior to deployment.  The team reported that they have already addressed this issue (and deployed the fix to the testing environment) so that testing by the community can continue.

It was noted that this issue involved a rounding error that is located in the AJV JSON validator package that CVE Services uses (it seems to also be an issue for various other JSON valication packages).  The fix involved modifying the CVE Services local copy of the JSON 5.1 schema to mitigate the anomilous ajv behaviour.  

It was suggested that the  QWG should consider how it was going to deal with this issue in the publicized version of the JSON 5.1 schema.   Two options were discussed (a) change the schema to ensure that this rounding issue will not occur in the ajv validator (and other validator that have the same issue) OR (b) message to CVE Community that using the schema as written may cause rounding issues in their local tooling that is inconsistent with CVE Services behavior.   Members of the QWG attending this meeting noted that their discussion of this topic at their last meeting resulted in a  "stand pat" position on this issue until the CVSS SIG "weighs in" on how they are going to deal with the general behavior of JSON validators in  CVSS 4.0 specification (which is the original spec that introduced this issue).  It was acknowledged that messaging to the community on this issue may be appropriate. 

## Decisions

* It was decided that the development team's implementation should "stand" and testing should carry on with the new rc to be considered for deployment.

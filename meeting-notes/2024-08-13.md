# August 13, 2024

## Agenda
*  Review Issues in the Triage Board that are tagged "needs discussion" with a goal to establish a way forward on these items (and remove the needs discussion tag)

## Notes
* Reviewed 5 items (and removed the the discussion tag).  Two items were closed.
  * [Issue #1077](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1077): Decision: Closed
  * [Issue #1129](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1129): Decision -  Documentation/Swagger update to better reflect interface behavior
  * [Issue #1137](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1037): Decision - Documentation/Swagger: update to better reflect interface behavior
  * [Issue #1138](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1138): Decision: Closed
  * [Issue #1141](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1141): CVE Services has been updated to not allow future dataPublished date (with a grace period).  However, there are other date fields which seem to have the same issue (with a potential rule to disallow future dates).  These other date fields are not specified as needing to be addressed in this user story.  Decision:  This user story will be udpated to include other date fields that need validation (i.,e cannot be a future date).  Action: the AWG Chair will identify the additional dates that this rule might apply to and add it to the user story for review.  Upon AWG review, the list will be sent to the QWG with the proposal for CVE services to enforce this new rule on these fields.   

## Decisions

*  Closed Issues: Issue #1087, Issue #1138
*  Decisions reached on: Issue #1129, Issue #1138   

## Action Items

* Action (AWG Chair): The AWG Chair will review the JSON 5.1 schema for optional date fields to propose for additional CVE Services validation (i.e, no future dates).  This list of fields will be reviewed by the AWG and then sent to the QWG for their concurrence of this new CVE Services Validation rule.

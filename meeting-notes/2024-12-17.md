# December 17, 2024

## Agenda

* Discuss architectural approaches for archiving CVE record references: https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/blob/master/meeting-notes/files/cve_reference_archival_reqs.md
  * Demo of ArchiveBox

## Notes

* Most discussion points summarized in doc referenced above.

## Decisions

* None, cost estimates have to be created for the proposed solutions to be able to recommend a final solution.

## Action Items

* (maybe) find a contact at the Library of Congress to discuss CVE ref archival
* (Martin) create a rough estimate of running ArchiveBox
* (Howard) create a rough architectural diagram of a Git-based archiving repo

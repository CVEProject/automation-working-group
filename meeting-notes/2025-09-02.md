## Agenda

* Reference Archive - [Product Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtDu3lVeNh65ul4fYxR7i10JyLyruUYQimPGVEqmoXQ/edit?tab=t.0) Review
  * Discussion topics:
    * Should the archived content be accessible to public, or just CNAs / CVE Program participants?
    * What should the UI/UX be for accessing archive content; comments in doc suggest that downloading a ZIP file is not acceptable
    * Cadence of archiving intervals: 0, 3, 10, 90 days; how can we determine the optimal cadence?

## Notes

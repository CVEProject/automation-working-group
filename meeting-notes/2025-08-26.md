# August 26, 2025

## Agenda

* Administrative: vote on AWG Charter approval
* CVE List Search capability test results - deployment discussion
* User Registry test release:
  * https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/releases/tag/ur-v0.2.0-beta.1
  * Update on [proposal #4](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCVEProject%2Fautomation-working-group%2F56da0e2c1984e7ed94effef1d45535735b822a94%2Fmeeting-notes%2Ffiles%2FAWG-user-registry-7-22.pptx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) from User Registry requirements (Organizational Unit)
* Reference Archive - [Product Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtDu3lVeNh65ul4fYxR7i10JyLyruUYQimPGVEqmoXQ/edit?tab=t.0) Review
  * Discussion topics:
    * Should the archived content be accessible to public, or just CNAs / CVE Program participants?
    * What should the UI/UX be for accessing archive content; comments in doc suggest that downloading a ZIP file is not acceptable
    * Cadence of archiving intervals: 0, 3, 10, 90 days; how can we determine the optimal cadence?
* CVE Services - requirements/sprint planning for purl schema update

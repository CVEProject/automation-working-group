## Agenda

* VulnCon Feedback
  * General feedback on tooling/services?
  * Are there any tooling-related blockers preventing other CNAs from becoming ADPs?
  * What other tools besides CVE Services should the CVE program provide for the community?
  * How can we better ensure CVE records meet a higher quality standard?
  * [@jgamblin](https://github.com/jgamblin): formal collection of all record validations that are defined in CVE Services (that aren't dependent on the schema)
    
* Test Release: cve.org Search capability
* Status: Reference Archive next steps
* Status: User Registry

# May 13, 2025

## Agenda

* Reminder: AWG Search Testing feedback due on 5/19 --- 5/20 meeting to discuss feedback and decide on required modifications (or deployment)
* CVE Services Release Candidate
* Comments/Review CVE Program Survey Data
* Deployment of CVE ref archival pilot

## Notes

* CVE Services release candidate 2.5.4 introduces a new unauthenticated endpoint (that supports state filtering): /cve_count
  * See impletation in https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/pull/1379 and https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/pull/1384
  * (discussion) Why not add a GraphQL endpoint that allows for more ad-hoc queries like this instead of creating feature-specific endpoints
    * Can be evaluated if requested as a feature, currently no support for GraphQL in CVE Services
    * It was discussed but requires a lot of time and effort to implement
* CVE survey discussion
  * Lack of officially-supported API leads to solutions such as https://github.com/vulsio/go-cve-dictionary/
  * Confusion between NVD and CVE Program data
  * Lack of data quality enforcement in the program, lots of CNAs that don't provide quality data leads to consumers looking elsewhere for it

## Decisions

* None

## Action Items

* Dave Waltermire: File an issue to explore adding a GraphQL API to CVE Services

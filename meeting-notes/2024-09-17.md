# September 17, 2024

## Agenda

* Correction of published/updated date fields for 27K records
* Update on schema change to add new CPE object
* User Registry stories and requirements:
  * Please contribute in https://docs.google.com/document/d/11dVHhvI9_0bGQss89DxvNTFa7pNW435UdG5x_qLqJmc/edit
* Discussion of https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/135
* CVE Services/CVE Repository Push notification mechanism

## Notes

* Timestamps of certain CVE records (27k) have been adjusted as part of: https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/issues/41#issuecomment-2356100742
* CPE object addition to CVE schema is still being voted on and discussed by the CVE board
  * PR is in draft: https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/135
* User Registry stories:
  * Further stories submitted by Madison discussed
  * Need to differentiate between stories that focus on improvement of current functionality vs a new User Registry module
* Discussion of https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/135

## Decisions

* Submit stories for CVE schema to standardize on UTC timestamps in CVE records and enforce uniform timestamps in CVE Services
  * Fix past records to include consistent timestamp values

## Action Items

* AI kris: contact developers of VINCE to discuss their user registry implementation

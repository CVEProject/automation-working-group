## Agenda

* Misc topics from VulnCon 2025:
  * General feedback on tooling/services?
  * Are there any tooling-related blockers preventing other CNAs from becoming ADPs?
  * What other tools besides CVE Services should the CVE program provide for the community?
  * How can we better ensure CVE records meet a higher quality standard?
  * [@jgamblin](https://github.com/jgamblin): formal collection of all record validations that are defined in CVE Services (that aren't dependent on the schema)
  * 
* Update on CVE ref archival pilot

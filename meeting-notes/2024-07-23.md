# July 23, 2024

## Agenda

* CVE Services rc 2.3.3 deployment decision
* Bulk Download Delta Utility Update

## Notes

* CVE Services rc 2.3.3 Deployment Decision:  It was agreed to deploy CVE Services rl candidate 2.3.3.  Release notes [here](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/releases/tag/v2.3.3).  Deployment was scheduled for July 24.

* Bulk Download Delta Utility Utility Update:  The bulkdownload delta file is a utility that aids downstream users in identifying which CVE Records in the CVE Repository have been modified (or added) over the course of time (e.g, the last hour).  It has been developed in support of the ongong CVE Record Search Capability develolpment.   This talk was about an update (i.e, Delta2) to this file that the developer has been working on that will offer more insight into the types of changes that CVE records might experience to better serve the downstream community (as well as internal development efforts).  Because of its usefulness in this development effort, the developer plans on making it available to the broader community as a Delta2 file that will be available as part of the Bulkdownload repository. See the AWG mailing list for the slides.

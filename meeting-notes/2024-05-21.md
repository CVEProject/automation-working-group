* Next Big Rock: ADP Clients

  The Authorized Data Publishing (ADP) capability is the next big automation initiative for the CVE Program.   CVE Services ADP interfaces were deployed (but not provisioned) in January/2024.   There have
  been two CVE Program ADP pilots that have been operating in the ADP Demonstration Environment (an environment exclusively used for ADP testing) since October/2024.    With the deployment of CVE Services
  2.3.0/CVE Record Format 5.1, the automation environment is now ready to accept ADP Clients.   Today we heard about the CISA ADP Vulnrichment Pilot.  There were a number of topics/questions/answers that
  were discussed during this part of the meeting.   Check out the recording [here](https://cve-cwe-programs.groups.io/g/AWG/files/MeetingRecordings) for the full discussion.

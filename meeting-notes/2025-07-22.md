* User Registry MVP: Design Discussion and Decision on Way forward ([slides](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCVEProject%2Fautomation-working-group%2F56da0e2c1984e7ed94effef1d45535735b822a94%2Fmeeting-notes%2Ffiles%2FAWG-user-registry-7-22.pptx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK))
  * P1: User/org JSON schema validation implementation
  * P2: Discuss and agree on proposal for "Implement the concept of an Organization Unit (OU)"
  * P3: Discuss and agree on proposal for "Maintain only one side of the org <-> user relationship"
  * P4: Discuss and agree on proposal for "Use org type specific collections to represent type specific data"
* Jo Bazar: Program Coordination Business Requirements ([slides](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/blob/56da0e2c1984e7ed94effef1d45535735b822a94/meeting-notes/files/CNA%20User%20Requirements%20by%20Role%20DRAFT.pptx))
* CVE reference archive: update and results of testing

## Notes

* P1-P3: agreement that it makes sense to implement these
  * approximately 8 weeks of dev time, 2 weeks of testing, early Oct MVP release
* P4: discussion around design, P4 can also be refined during the implementation of P1-P3
  * start P1-P3, re-assess timelines on P4 and finalize design of P4 with a focused design team (Dave Waltermire to lead this effort)
* Release of MVP should include all P1-P4

## Decisions

* User Registry Deployment Postponement - It was decided that the AWG should support an MVP that contains all 4 proposals even if the deployment is pushed early next year (2026).  Implementation on proposal 1-3 will begin immediately with incrementatl test releases into the testing environment for community review.
* It was agreed that more discussion was needed around the implementation of Proposal 4.  An AWG sub group would be formed to work these design/implementation issues out of the band of the normal AWG meeting. 

## Action Items

[] David Waltermire: organize an AWG subgroup to discuss proposal 4 design/implementation.

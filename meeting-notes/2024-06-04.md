# June 04, 2024

## Agenda

* CISA ADP deployment update
* Vendor usage of CVE Program Automation Tools Discussion/Presentation: Shelby Cunningham (GitHub)
  * Sign-up to present here: [#127](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/127)
* AWG Charter review status
  * Review of open issues: [#129](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/129), [#130](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/130)
  * Review of open PRs: [#128](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/pull/128)

## Notes

* CISA-enriched ADP containers are now present for ~7k CVE records
  * Example: https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/cve/CVE-2024-36400
  * [vulnrichment](https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment) repo will continue to house the CISA-specific data
    * A question was raised of whether it makes sense to duplicate full CVE records in this repo, potentially introducing competing data sets with the official cvelist_v5 repo
  * An announcement will be sent out later to inform the CVE community of these enriched ADP containers
* AWG Charter changes submitted by @jgamblin approved and merged
  * Discussion of [#129](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/129): it was decided no changes were required here and the issue was closed (see comment in the issue)
  * Discussion of [#130](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/issues/130): @jgamblin will submit the proposed rule of 25% total votes by a single organization in a separate PR
## Decisions

* None

## Action Items

[] Jerry Gamblin: Provide an AWG Charter update to reflect an organizational voting representation constraint of 25% of total votes by a single organization.

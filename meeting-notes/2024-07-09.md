## Notes

At the 23 July AWG meeting we will review the testing results/feedback from the community and make a deployment recommendation for July 24.
  
* 2nd ADP Deployment status: Secretariat Reference Ingest - It was reported that the Secretariat Reference Ingest Pilot was on schedule to deploy on July 17.  The nature of the deployment was discussed.

# AWG Meeting Notes

This directory contains meeting notes for AWG meetings beginning on February 13, 2024 moving forward.

Between November/2020 and February/2024 meeting minutes, discussions, and decisions were recorded on the AWG Groups.io email list and Groups.io AWG groups page. Beginning February 13, 2024, minutes of meeting will be hosted in individual files in this directory. Proposed agenda topics, community discussions, and recorded decisions will continue to be distributed through the AWG Groups.io to subscribed AWG members. Each AWG email proposing agenda items for a meeting will have a link to the relevant meeting notes file to allow for quick access to those receiving the email.

The format of the meeting notes file will be a series of sections copied from the `_template.md` file in this directory. Prior to the meeting, the agenda section of the meeting notes file will be pre-populated with the agenda items for that meeting. Any member of the community can propose additional information for any meeting by issuing a Github Pull Request (PR). PRs will be moderated (and committed) by the AWG Chair.

It is expected that AWG members will contribute to each of the sections of the meeting notes file through additional PRs. Without AWG membership contribution, some sections may remain empty.

* CVE Services Deployment Plan/Scorecard
* CVE Service Sprint Planning/Issue Prioritization

## Notes

* CVE Service rc 2.3.0 Testing Results/deployment blockers

  Testing Period for CVE Services 2.3.0 is over this week.   The following issues were reported in the testing period and adjudicated: 
  - [Issue #1216](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1216)
  - [Issue #1210](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1210)
  - [Issue #1209](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1209)
  - [Issue #1207](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1207)
  - [Issue #1206](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1206)

 Each of these issues were deemed to be "non blockers" to the deployment of CVE Services 2.3.0 and would be addressed in priority order after deployment. (See Decisions).

 * CVE Service 2.3.0 Deployment Plan/Scorecard

   Schedule deployment for CVE Services 2.3.0 is April 24.   The AWG Chair proposed that the AWG makes it deploy/no deploy decision at its April 23 meeting.  The chair 
   will request that the TWG to apriori abide by the AWG decision on April 23 

   The following "scorecard" was agreed to as a framework for making the deployment decision:

   legend:
     - green: complete
     - yellow: in pogress
     - white/green outline:  uknown
  
   Explanation:
     - CVE Services Testing/Functional Testing:  White pending today's discussion on testing results.  After today's discussion this will turn to Green
     - CVE SErvices Testing/Integration Testing: This testing is not complete but is in progress
     - Client Support: cvelib, cveClient have have not yet adopted JSON 5.1 but there are plans for this to complete by the 24th.  After this meeting, these will turn to
       yellow.   It was noted that Vulnogram currently has an option to support 5.1.  This will turn to green after this meeting.
     - Communication Plan:  Individual CNAs have been contacted but there still remains a small number of records that will not be 5.1.0 compliant.  After today's meeting this will turn to yellow pending a discussion with the TWG/QWG on whether 100% of CNAs need to be compliant before CVE Services 2.3.0 is deployed.   Commms plans for general community contact and Downstream users will be complete this week.
     - CVE Services 2.3.0 Deployment procedures will be complete this week

 * CVE Services Sprint Planning/Issue Prioritization
     There were three "inputs" for prioritization planning that resulted in the following issue scoring for next priorities.  It was decided not to extend the "voting"    input period for requirements prioritization.  The deveveopment team will begin sprint planning based on this input.

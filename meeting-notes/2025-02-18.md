## Agenda

* CVE Services 2.5.2 Testing Results: Deployment Decision: CVE Services [Issue # 1342](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/1342)
* Discuss CVE reference archival pilot plan
* User Registry user stories

## Notes

* CVE Services 2.5.2 Testing Results

Issue #1342 was reported this week as the AWG was considering deployment of CVE Services 2.5.2.  This issue identified a "side channel" information lead associated with the Bulkdownload Role (The Bulkdownload role is a CVE Repository "read only" role that supports the retrieval of CVE information about Reserved CVE IDs and Published CVE Records.  CVE Services 2.5.2 modifies GET /cve-id endpoint in a manner that redacts embargoed data (i.e, the CVE ID owner).  Issue #1342 notes observes that, although the modification successfully redacts the CVE ID owner information, there is a process that a user with the  Bulkdownload role could obtain the owner of the reserved CVE-ID.    

After some discussion, it was decided, that although this "side channnel" of information flow did indeed exist, because the Bulkdownload is carefully distributed (i.e., it is not a role that is avaialable to a wide community) that the current implementation was reasonable and that the risk of abuse of this side channel was minimal.    The AWG concurred to deploy CVE services 2.5.2 as implemented and tested.  

* CVE reference archival pilot:
  * Join #archiver on https://cve-cna.slack.com/archives/C08CV252TJN
  * Individual phases and their requirements will be defined in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVIm6Mv2xwYODsbS1z471XdHnA5Qffk7nADLeLX_spA/edit?tab=t.0
  * Ensure each phase results in operational documentation to see how archival would function if it were to be adopted to the CVE project

## Decisions

* In considering Issue #1352 in the context of the request to deploy CVE Services 2.5.2 to PRODUCTION, the AWG concurred that risk introduced by this change is minimal and that CVE Services 2.5.2`

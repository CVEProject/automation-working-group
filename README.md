## Introduction

The Automation Working Group seeks to leverage automation technologies to reduce the workload related to vulnerability counting and description writing and to create a sharing model for CVE based on an open format. In this repository you will find mostly "logistics" type of information, specifically the AWG Charter and meeting minutes (beginning from February/2024)  

Prior to February/2024 meeting notes were recorded on the AWG email list which is hosted by the Groups.io group faciliation service.  In the interest of more transpaency to the broader community (and encouraging participationg within the community) meeting notes are now being hosted in this repository with public read access.  

The AWG meets virtually (i.e., Microsoft Team meeting) every Tuesday, 4:00 PM Eastern Time.  If you are interested in participating in these meetings send a request to AWG@CVE-CWE-Programs.groups.io.

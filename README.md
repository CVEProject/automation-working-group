## Introduction

The Automation Working Group seeks to leverage automation technologies to reduce the workload related to reporting and managing vulnerabilities with an open data model. In this repository you will find mostly "logistics" related to the execution of the AWG objectives, specifically the AWG Charter and meeting minutes (beginning from February/2024).

Prior to February/2024 meeting notes were recorded on the AWG email list which is hosted by the Groups.io group facilitation service. In the interest of more transparency to the broader community (and encouraging participation within the community), meeting notes are now being hosted in this repository with public read access. If you wish to review meeting minutes prior to February/2024, join the AWG and you will have access to its email archives.

## Joining the AWG

The AWG holds virtual meetings (Microsoft Teams) every Tuesday at two alternating times: 4:00 PM ET one week, then 9:00 AM ET the following week. If you are interested in joining the AWG you can send an email request to AWG@CVE-CWE-Programs.groups.io or you can submit a request to the CVE Program Secretariat using [this](https://cveform.mitre.org/) web form (choose "other" for Request Type and "other" for "Type of Comment" and request to join the AWG in the "Comment Section").

## CVE Schema Content Changes

CVE schema and schema discussion has been migrated to its own repository under the CVE Project: https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema.

# JSON File format 2.x for DWF Database Artifacts entry

This is the current version in use.

# ChangeLog by version

2.0 initial version

2.1 added "URL" to DWF AFFECTS (URL for that particular product)

2.2 added DATE_REQUESTED, DATE_ASSIGNED, DATE_PUBLIC, REQUESTER, ASSIGNER, REPLACED_BY,  STATE, TITLE  to root so we can generate CSV entries from the JSON artifact, MANDATORY fields, please note some are generated by the DWF (e.g. DATE_ASSIGNED). 

2.3 added IMPACT to DWF, new MANDATORY field.

2.4 Moved IMPACT to description

## Other changes by date

2016-11-13 Added Minimum CVE request file example and updated documentation, removed SUGGESTED keyword

# Definition of terms

## OPTIONAL

2.0: If a field is OPTIONAL it does not need to be included. As always more information is better then less information.

## MANDATORY

2.0: If a field is MANDATORY it MUST be included or else the entry is invalid.

# Minimum file example

An example of a minimum file entry for the DWF. The description is required for PUBLIC entries (that is to say published in our database), please consult our writing guidelines, alternatively if sufficient other data (AFFECTS, CVSSv2 or CVSSv3 scoring data and so on) is provided the DWF can write the entry (indeed it is our hope to automate descriptions based on data for the vulnerability). Simply search for "MINIMUM" to find the descriptions for the various components needed to make a minimal entry. Many of the fields are created by the DWF (e.g. CVE number and the creation date).

# DATA_VERSION

2.0: This is a restricted keyword and MUST be used to indicate the version of data used. The JSON file has various information sections (the global section, the DWF section, etc.) and some of these sections can have subsections (the CVSSv2, CVSSv3, AFFECTED data items and so on). The format of these sections and items may be updated to include new information or change how information is presented. In order to signal what version of data formatting is in use the JSON file has a global version, and sections and items within a section can have their own versions (e.g. in AFFECTED you can have multiple items with different data versions potentially). This means that data formatted in old formats (e.g. the 2.0 definition) can continue to coexist in a file with other sections that have been updated (e.g. to 2.1). The version of formatting used in a section is the same as defined in it's parent section unless otherwise explicitly stated (so until there is an update to the 2.0 format all data can be assumed to be in the 2.0 format). MANDATORY (for the root level DATA_VERSION entry only, the rest are optional).

# UPDATED

2.0: The latest date and time (in ISO 8601 format) that this information was updated. Generated by DWF. MANDATORY

# SERIAL

2.0: An integer serial number for the entry that starts at "1" is incremented by 1 for every update committed. Generated by DWF. MANDATORY

# CVE_ID

2.0: The CVE number assigned to this issue. Needed for the MINIMUM entry, is generated by the DWF project. Usually (but not always) generated by the DWF. MANDATORY

# DATE_REQUESTED

2.2: Date the CVE was requested. Generated by DWF. MANDATORY

# DATE_ASSIGNED

2.2: Date the CVE was assigned. Generated by DWF. MANDATORY

# DATE_PUBLIC

2.2: Date the CVE went public. Generated by DWF. MANDATORY

# REQUESTER

2.2: Requestor ID (typically an Email address) of the CVE, MANDATORY

# ASSIGNER

2.2: Assigner ID (typically an Email address) of the CVE, typically generated by DWF, MANDATORY

# REPLACED_BY

2.2: replace by information, typically generated by DWF, OPTIONAL

# STATE

2.2.: CVE STATE information, typically generated by DWF, OPTIONAL

# TITLE 

2.2: short title for the CVE, in case the description is very long.

# NOTES

2.0: This is a restricted keyword and must be used for notes, please note that the NOTE object can occur in any object list (e.g. in AFFECTS, VENDOR, CVSSv3, etc. area). A notes field for the global section that consists of a list of objects in the form of ISO-639-2 language (this allows for translations) and a string of text data (the note). Also can include DATA_VERSION. OPTIONAL. This can also occur in other sections/item entries.

# DWF

The DWF hierarchy of data is strictly formatted and MUST conform to documented standards or else it will be rejected. Also can include DATA_VERSION.

## PROBLEM_TYPE

The problem type, a list of objects in the form of identifier and a value, currently allowed values are CWE (a CWE value), OWASP (an OWASP value) and DESCRIPTION (a text description in the same format as NOTES, e.g. with language identifier and data). One or more of these values is MANDATORY. Also can include DATA_VERSION.

## IMPACT

2.3: The impact of exploitation, a keyword, tag or short description. Current examples include: Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Other, Escalation of Privileges. This field is MANDATORY so we can determine if a CVE is needed for the issue.

### CWE

2.0: The CWE ID in the form "CWE-N" or a string of vulnerabilities that describe this issue, comma separated (e.g. "CWE-N,CWE-N2"). 

### OWASP

# DRAFT - CVE ID JSON File Format 4.0

This describes the CVE ID JSON format version 4.0, and this file format primarily covers CVE ID but also CVE Mentors and CNAs.

CVE_* is a reserved keyword. Essentially every CVE ID file is a JSON Object that contains more top level objects which in turn contain objects/arrays/booleans/etc. We have some required top level objects: CVE_data_type (what is this file?), CVE_data_format (who’s format is it in?) and CVE_data_version (what version of the data format is this?) for all types.

CVE_* keywords are officially documented (this document), if you see one that isn’t here then it’s not an official keyword, and you can ignore it. To add/modify/suggest changes to CVE_* keywords and their data structures please do X (issue in GitHub? TBD) so that we can consider it. 

# Notes on data within the JSON file format

## Timestamps

Timestamps are in ISO 8601, as per the standard if no time zone is specified it is assumed to be local, obviously, that is sub optimal for CVE so we will probably need to require all timestamps have a time zone specified, ideally UTC. Alternatively we can make it a requirement for CNA's to only accept data that is well formed (e.g. timestamps must require timezone data) but then we run the risk of rejecting data that is useful because part of it is not "correct." 

## Leap seconds

Subtracted leap seconds should be acceptable as timestamps will only be off by a second or two at most (and only once in a very rare while), added leap seconds (e.g. 11:59:60) will be rounded down (e.g. 11:59:60 becomes 11:59:59) as we can live with this level of clock skewing. Please note that the CVE test data will likely include timestamps with leap seconds to ensure systems handle them properly if they are encountered, but as CVE data is then passed to other systems and processed in ways we can't know it is safer to get rid of leap seconds.  

## Unicode

Data may be Unicode encoded, titles, descriptions, researcher names, version numbers (people use alphabetical versioning, so we should expect this but in other character sets/languages). Data should no longer be assumed to be simple ASCII all the time. 

## UUencoded data

File objects associated with CVE IDs may sometimes be embedded within the JSON data as a UUncoded object (optionally zip compressed and password protected in the case where the data may trigger an AV scanner for example). Again, this data may be dangerous or actively hostile depending on what software you use to process it.

## Base64 data

File objects associated with CVE IDs may sometimes be embedded within the JSON data as a Base64 object (optionally zip compressed and password protected in the case where the data may trigger an AV scanner for example). Again, this data may be dangerous or actively hostile depending on what software you use to process it.

## Multiple line strings

For data (such as gpg keys, copies of text, etc.) that consists of a multiline string we will simply use "\n" to insert line breaks (JSON strings cannot have actual line breaks). An example of code that can generate such a JSON object is:

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import json
with open(“multi-line.txt", "r") as file:
    multilinestring=file.read()
jsonexample={“string_name”: multilinestring}
print json.dumps(jsonexample)
```

This is not ideally human readable, but there is no good simple solution for this unfortunately.

# CVE ID JSON root level object

The CVE ID JSON format is comprised of a number of strings (CVE_data_type, CVE_data_format, CVE_data_version) and then a variety of top level objects, referred to as "containers" that can in turn contain more container objects, strings, lists of data and so on. Essentially the "root" object is just a JSON object "{}".

# CVE JSON string items

There are several special string values that can exist at the root level of the CVE ID JSON data, and one special one, the CVE_data_version, which can exist in the root or within any container.

## data_type

This string identifies what kind of data is held in this JSON file. This is mandatory and designed to prevent problems with attempting to detect what kind of file this is. Valid values for this string are CVE, CNA, CVEMENTOR. 

Must contain: the CVE data type

Mandatory in: root level

Optional in: none

JSON data type: string

## data_format

This string identifies what data format is used in this JSON file. This is mandatory and designed to prevent problems with attempting to detect what format of data is used. Valid values for this string are MITRE, it can also be user defined (e.g. for internal use). 

Must contain: the CVE data format

Mandatory in: root level

Optional in: all containers

JSON data type: string

## data_version

This identifies which version of the data format is in use. This is mandatory and designed to prevent problems with attempting to detect what format of data is used.

Must contain: the data version

Mandatory in: root level, any containers not in same version as parent container/root level object

Optional in: all containers

JSON data type: string

# CVE ID JSON containers 

These objects can in turn contain more objects, arrays, strings and so on. The reason for this is so that each top level object type can contain self-identifying data such as CVE_Data_version. Most objects can in turn contains virtually any other object. In general, if you traverse into the nested tree of objects you should not encounter any chains that contains more than one instance of a given object container. Simply put you should not for example encounter a chain such as: root, CVE_affects, CVE_configuration, CVE_workaround, CVE_configuration. Please note that this rule may be subject to change as we get new container types and use cases. 

JSON data type: object

## affects

This is the root level container for affected vendors and in turn their affected technologies, products, hardware, etc. It only goes in the root level. 

Must contain: At least one vendor definition

Mandatory in: root level

Optional in: none

JSON data type: object

## vendor

This is the container for affected vendors, it only goes in the affects container. 

Must contain: At least one product definition (in vendor_data)

Mandatory in: affects, there must be at least one defined vulnerable product either in the form of a text description (via data defined in vendor, product, version) OR a affects_CPE OR a affects_SWID

Optional in: none

JSON data type: object

### vendor_data

This is an array of version values (vulnerable and not); we use an array so that different entities can make statements about the same vendor and they are separate (if we used a JSON object we'd essentially be keying on the vendor name and they would have to overlap). Also this allows things like data_version or description to be applied directly to the vendor entry.

Must contain: One of the vendor definitions must contains at least one product definition (so there must be a minimum of one full declaration of a vulnerable product)

Mandatory in: vendor

Optional in: none

JSON data type: array that contains objects

#### vendor_name

The vendor name

#### product

See the product for a full definition

## product

This is the container for affected technologies, products, hardware, etc.

Must contain: At least one affected item by name (CNA requirement: [PRODUCT])

Mandatory in: vendor

Optional in: none

JSON data type: object

### product_data

This is an array of version values (vulnerable and not); we use an array so that we can make multiple statements about the same product and they are separate (if we used a JSON object we'd essentially be keying on the product name and they would have to overlap). Also this allows things like data_version or description to be applied directly to the product entry.

Must contain: One of the product definitions must contains at least one version definition (so there must be a minimum of one full declaration of a vulnerable product)

Mandatory in: product

Optional in: none

JSON data type: array that contains objects

Must contain: At least one affected version (CNA requirement: [VERSION]) 

Mandatory in: product

Optional in: none

JSON data type: object

### version_data

This is an array of version values (vulnerable and not); we use an array so that we can make multiple statements about the same version and they are separate (if we used a JSON object we'd essentially be keying on the version name/number and they would have to overlap). Also this allows things like data_version or description to be applied directly to the product entry. This also allows more complex statements such as "Product X between versions 10.2 and 10.8" to be put in a machine-readable format. As well since multiple statements can be used multiple branches of the same product can be defined here.

Must contain: One of the product definitions must contains at least one version definition (so there must be a minimum of one full declaration of a vulnerable product)

Mandatory in: version

Optional in: none

JSON data type: array that contains objects

#### version_value

Must contain: At least one CPE definition (in affects_CPE_data)

Mandatory in: affects, there must be at least one defined vulnerable product either in the form of a text description (via data defined in vendor, product, version) OR a affects_CPE OR a affects_SWID

Optional in: none

JSON data type: object

## affects_CPE_data

This is an array of CPE values (vulnerable and not), we use an array so that we can make multiple statements about the same version and they are separate (if we used a JSON object we'd essentially be keying on the CPE name and they would have to overlap). Also this allows things like CVE_data_version or CVE_description to be applied directly to the product entry. This also allows more complex statements such as "Product X between versions 10.2 and 10.8" to be put in a machine-readable format. As well since multiple statements can be used multiple branches of the same product can be defined here.

Must contain: One of the product definitions must contains at least one CVE_version definition (so there must be a minimum of one full declaration of a vulnerable product)

Mandatory in: affects_CPE

Optional in: none

JSON data type: array that contains objects

## affects_SWID

This is an array of SWID values (vulnerable and not), we use an array so that we can make multiple statements about the same version and they are separate (if we used a JSON object we'd essentially be keying on the SWID name and they would have to overlap). Also this allows things like CVE_data_version or CVE_description to be applied directly to the product entry.

Optional in: all containers

JSON data type: object

## references 

This is reference data in the form of URLs or file objects (uuencoded and embedded within the JSON file, exact format to be decided, e.g. we may require a compressed format so the objects require unpacking before they are "dangerous").

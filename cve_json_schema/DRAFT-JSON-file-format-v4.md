# DRAFT - CVE ID JSON File Format 4.0

This describes the CVE ID JSON format version 4.0, this file format primarily covers CVE ID but also CVE Mentors and CNAs.

CVE_* is a reserved keyword. Essentially every CVE ID file is a JSON Object that contains more top level objects which in turn contain objects/arrays/booleans/etc. We have some required top level objects: `CVE_data_type` (what is this file?), `CVE_data_format` (who’s format is it in?) and CVE_data_version (what version of the data format is this?) for all types.

CVE_* keywords are officially documented (this document), if you see one that isn’t here then it’s not an official keyword, and you can ignore it. To add/modify/suggest changes to CVE_* keywords and their data structures please do X (issue in GitHub? TBD) so that we can consider it. 

# Notes on data within the JSON file format

## Timestamps

Timestamps are in ISO 8601, as per the standard if no timezone is specified it is assumed to be local, obviously that is sub optimal for CVE so we will probably need to require all timestamps have a timezone specified, ideally UTC.

## Leapseconds

Subtracted leapseconds don't really affect us, added leapseconds (e.g. 11:59:60) will be rounded down (e.g. 11:59:60 becomes 11:59:59) as we can live with this level of clock skewing. Please note that the CVE test data will likely include timestamps with leapseconds to ensure systems handle them properly if they are encountered, but as CVE data is then passed to other systems and processed in ways we can't know it is safer to get rid of leap seconds.  

## Unicode

Data may be unicode encoded, titles, descriptions, researcher names, version numbers (people use alphabetical versioning, so we should expect this but in other character sets/languages). Data should no longer be assumed to be simple ascii all the itme. 

## UUEncoded data

File objects associated with CVEs may sometimes be embedded within the JSON data as a uuencoded object (optionally zip compressed and password protected in the case where the data may trigger an AV scanner for example). Again this data may be dangerous or actively hostile depending on what software you use to process it.

# CVE ID JSON root level object

The CVE ID JSON format is comprised of a number of strings (`CVE_data_type`, `CVE_data_format`, `CVE_data_version`) and then a variety of top level objects, referred to as "containers" that can in turn contain more container objects, strings, lists of data and so on. Essentially the "root" object is just a JSON object "{}".

# CVE JSON string items

There are several special string values that can exist at the root level of the CVE ID JSON data, and one special one, the CVE_data_version, which can exist in the root or within any container.

## CVE_data_type

This string identifies what kind of data is held in this JSON file. This is mandatory and designed to prevent problems with attempting to detect what kind of file this is. Valid values for this string are CVE, CNA, CVEMENTOR. 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | the CVE data type |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level|
|**Optional in:**| none|

## CVE_data_format

This string identifies what data format is used in this JSON file. This is mandatory and designed to prevent problems with attempting to detect what format of data is used. Valid values for this string are MITRE, it can also be user defined (e.g. for internal use). 


|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | the CVE data format |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level|
|**Optional in:**| all containers|

## CVE_data_version

This identifies which version of the data format is in use. This is mandatory and designed to prevent problems with attempting to detect what format of data is used.

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | the CVE data format |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level, any containers not in same version as parent container/root level object|
|**Optional in:**| all containers|


# CVE ID JSON containers 

These objects can in turn contain more objects, arrays, strings and so on. The reason for this is so that each top level object type can contain self identifying data such as `CVE_Data_version`. Most objects can in turn contains virtually any other object. In general if you traverse into the nested tree of objects you should not encounter any chains that contains more than one instance of a given object container. Simply put you should not for example encounter a chain such as: root, `CVE_affects`, `CVE_configuration`, `CVE_workaround`, `CVE_configuration`. Please note that this rule may be subject to change as we get new container types and use cases. 

## CVE_data_meta 

This is meta data about the CVE ID such as the CVE ID, who requested it, who assigned it, when it was requested, when it was assigned, the current state (PUBLIC, REJECT, etc.) and so on. 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | CVE ID (CNA requirement: [CVEID]) |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root levelt|
|**Optional in:**| none|

### UPDATED 

`DATE-TIMESTAMP` - last update time for this entry

### SERIAL

`INT` - starts at 1, add 1 everytime an entry is updated/changed

### CVE_ID

`CVE-YEAR-NNNNNNN`- the CVE ID in the format listed in http://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html#new

### DATE_REQUESTED

`DATE-TIMESTAMP` - the date/time this issue was requested

### DATE_ASSIGNED

`DATE-TIMESTAMP` - the date/time this was assigned

### DATE_PUBLIC

`DATE_PUBLIC` - the date/time this issue went public if known

### REQUESTER

`Requestor ID` - the requestor of the CVE (email address)

### ASSIGNER

`Assigner ID` - the assigner of the CVE (email address)

### REPLACED_BY

`replaced by data` - a single CVE or list of CVEs (comma seperated) 

### STATE

`State of CVE` - PUBLIC, RESERVED, REPLACED_BY, SPLIT_FROM, MERGED_TO

### TITLE

`Short title` - if the description is long we may want a short title to refer to

## CVE_affects

This is the root level container for affected vendors and in turn their affected technologies, products, hardware, etc. It only goes in the root level. 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one CVE_vendor definition |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level|
|**Optional in:**| none|

## CVE_vendor

This is the container for affected vendors, it only goes in the CVE_affects container. 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one CVE_product definition. |
|**Mandatory in:**|  CVE_affects|
|**Optional in:**| none|

## CVE_product

This is the container for affected technologies, products, hardware, etc.

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one affected item by name (CNA requirement: [PRODUCT]) |
|**Mandatory in:**|  CVE_vendor|
|**Optional in:**| none|

## CVE_version 

This is the container for listing the affected/non affected/fixed versions of a given technology, product, hardware, etc.

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one affected version (CNA requirement: [VERSION])  |
|**Mandatory in:**|  CVE_product|
|**Optional in:**| none|

## CVE_description 

This is a description of the issue. It can exist in the root level or within virtually any other container. The intent being that for example different products, and configurations may result in different impacts and thus descriptions of the issue. 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one description (CNA requirement: [DESCRIPTION]) |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level|
|**Optional in:**| all containers |

## CVE_configuration 

This is configuration information (format to be decided, we may for example support XCCDF or simple text based descriptions). It is generally meant to contain additional containers (e.g. `CVE_description`, `CVE_impact`). 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one configuration |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level|
|**Optional in:**| all containers |

## CVE_references 

This is reference data in the form of URLs or file objects (uuencoded and embedded within the JSON file, exact format to be decided, e.g. we may require a compressed format so the objects require unpacking before they are "dangerous"). 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** | At least one reference item  (CNA requirement: [REFERENCES]) |
|**Mandatory in:**|  root level |
|**Optional in:**| all containers |

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** |  At least one timeline entry.|
|**Mandatory in:**|  none |
|**Optional in:**| all containers |


## CVE_credit 

This is credit information (different than `CVE_timeline` in that these are specific things being credited to specific people/organizations/etc.), format to be decided. 

|Guidelines||
|----|----|
|**Must contain:** |  At least one credit entry.|
|**Mandatory in:**|  none |
|**Optional in:**| all containers |

## CVE_problemtype 

This is problem type information (e.g. CWE identifier).
